  <p class="headline">Beyoncé: The Movement</p>

  <p class="byline">By: Maddie Osgood</p>

<!--INTRO-->
  <p>Protests erupted around the world following the death of George Floyd.</p>

  <p>Floyd was killed while in police custody on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His death reignited the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

  <p>“The killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and so many others have left us all broken,” said Beyoncé in an Instagram video.</p>

  <p>Beyoncé released the song “Black Parade” on Juneteenth. The surprise release brought attention to the holiday, which celebrates the emancipation of those who were enslaved in the United States. The single supports the Black Parade project, which is an online directory of black-owned businesses. She announced the release of her visual album “Black is King”. The visual album pays tribute to Black history and celebrates Black culture. </p>

<!--BLM Movement-->
  <p class="chapter" id="move">The Movement</p>

  <p>The Black Lives Matter movement was founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer. The movement became recognized for protests following street demonstrations after the deaths Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014.</p>

 <p>According to the Black Lives Matter website, the organization’s “movement is to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.”</p>

 <p>The Black Lives Matter movement has focused its purpose to raise awareness of police brutality.</p>

 <p>Law enforcement has a racist history in the United States. Slave patrols acted as an early form of policing, dating back to 1704. Slave patrols promoted violent and racist behavior towards African Americans. Slave patrols created the basis to the evolution of policing in the United States.</p>

 <p>Today, police brutality and racial bias remain prominent. According to data collected from Mapping Police Violence, black Americans are three times more likely to be killed by police than white Americans. Black Americans are also 1.3 times more likely to be killed by police while unarmed than white Americans.</p>

  <p>The Black Lives Matter movement calls for reform within police departments in order to end police brutality.</p>

  <p>Beyoncé has become a spokesperson for the Black Lives Matter movement, using her platform to inform. Her music focuses on Black empowerment, but she did not have this focus in her earlier career.</p>

<!--Formation-->
  <p class="chapter" id="perform">The Formation</p>
  <p>Beyoncé rose to fame as the lead singer of "Destiny’s Child" in the late 1990s. She recorded his first solo album ‘Dangerously in Love’ in 2003. Her solo career led to the disbandment of "Destiny’s Child" in 2006.</p>

  <p>Her music was filled with narratives of relationship turmoil, romance, and love. This rhetoric and her girl band past gave her the reputation as a diva in her career.</p>

  <p>In 2016, Beyoncé released “Formation” and its accompanying video on February 6. It was her first new single since 2014.</p>

  <p>“Formation” was unlike any of her previous work. The song was filled with political narrative. It did not fulfill the diva image Beyoncé portrayed.</p>

  <p> The music video portrays an antebellum South setting while representing the modern culture of African Americans. It referenced Black Lives Matter with walls covered with “Stop Shooting Us” graffiti, Beyoncé sitting on a sinking police car, and a young boy dancing in front of police in riot gear.</p>

  <p>The video was shot in New Orleans and portrays the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina brought attention to the racial inequalities in New Orleans. Impoverished, African American communities, like the Lower Ninth Ward, struggled to rebuild. The setting of the music video amplifies the message of ‘Formation’.</p>

  <p>She performed “Formation” live for the first time on February 7 at the 2016 NFL Super Bowl halftime show. The performance did not stray from the songs message.</p>

  <p>Her dancers wore all black outfits with black berets that resembled the Black Panther Party during the 1960s. Beyoncé’s costume resembled the costume Michael Jackson wore during the 1993 Super Bowl halftime show in 1993. References to Malcom X were shown during the performance, when the dancers created an ‘X’ formation on the field.</p>

  <p>Bakari Kitwana, the CEO of ‘Rap Sessions’, voiced his opinion about Beyoncé’s performance in an interview for CNN in 2016.</p>

  <p>"There's definitely an evolution going on with Beyoncé. It shows you how smart she is. She's tapping into the same consumer culture that she’s always tapped into but she’s doing it with some political overtones," Kitwana said.</p>

  <p>Her performance sparked controversy in the media. The audience took to Twitter to express their thoughts on the halftime performance. Some viewers felt offended by the political message, while others felt empowered. </p>

<!--Lemonade-->

  <p class="chapter" id="lemonade">The Album</p>

  <p>Beyoncé released her sixth solo album, “Lemonade”, on April 23, 2016. The album was accompanied by an hour-long HBO special also titled “Lemonade”.</p>

  <p>The visual album was divided into eleven chapters, each representing a narrative of reconciliation. The album seems to be about rebuilding a relationship that was broken, presumably Beyoncé’s relationship with husband Jay-Z.</p>

  <p>The broader context of the album represents the brokenness of the American South that has led to the racial inequalities in the United States. It highlights the experiences of Black women to set a tone of empowerment.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The twelve-song album creates a sound that mixes soul, R&B, country, hip-hop, and rock genres. Songs like “Daddy Lessons” create a strong country style, with banjo and guitar riffs. “Freedom” mixes hip-hop and rock in order to create an anthem of empowerment for African Americans. “Sorry” uses hip-hop and R&B beats to create an unapologetic, upbeat tempo. Each song is individual in its style and message, but all work together.</p>

  <p>The Formation World Tour was announced after Beyoncé’s 2016 Super Bowl halftime show performance. The tour allowed “Lemonade” to gain global exposure, delivering the message of Black empowerment outside of the United States.</p>

  <p>Her ominous yet respected presence in the music industry proves the power she holds. Every time she makes an appearance, its more impactful than the last. “Lemonade” marked the newly politicized chapter in Beyoncé’s career.</p>
